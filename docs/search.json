    "text": "This page has info on how to apply to ecology, evolutionary biology, behavior, and related fields for graduate school. Our focus is the US. The goal is to expose some of the “hidden curriculum” – some of the information that some people know (for example, if their parents are professors) but might not invisible to those with different backgrounds. Note our potential conflicts of interest as faculty who mentor grad students and also serve on an admissions committee: we could inadvertently be painting a too positive picture of the process. There can also be substantial differences across fields: some of this could apply to a PhD program in history, for example, but some might be terrible. We also come with particular backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences: they might not match your experience or predict how things will work out for you. Searching for “hidden curriculum” and “graduate school” will bring up many more resources.\n\n\nGraduate school is where you study for a Masters or PhD. In ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB), a Masters can be coursework-based (like most bachelors degrees: take this many classes, have a high enough average, get a degree) or research-based (like a PhD, but shorter and with less research). A PhD is a research degree: you do a lot of research, write a dissertation, and defend it. You also take classes, but the focus is on research. A Masters degree typically takes 2-3 years, a PhD 5-6 years. Sometimes people get a Masters degree while on the way to a PhD; sometimes they get a Masters at one institution and a PhD at another; sometimes they go directly from undergrad to a PhD program.\n\n\n\nCoursework-based Masters, especially if the target audience is professionals who need a degree for professional development, will usually cost tuition. Research-based Masters, and PhD programs, actually pay you to go. Technically, this is usually pay for teaching (as a teaching assistant, or “TA” or “GTA”) and/or for doing funded research (a research assistant, an “RA” or “GRA” [not “RA” as in “resident advisor”, a person who helps students staying in dorms]). This usually covers tuition, a modest stipend, and enrolls you in a healthcare program. It may or may not cover fees, which can sometimes be substantial. https://www.phdstipends.com has crowd-sourced information on stipends PhD students a paid in different schools and programs so you can get a sense of the range of values; most programs will also put their base stipend on their websites. Note that the stipends on PhDStipends.com might include bonus fellowships, or might be for students on research assistantships where the base pay is higher (because that is how the grant budget is written) – you might get a different amount. Stipends in EEB might be as low as $20,000 but go as high as $45,000 or more. However, cost of living can vary dramatically, as well: a moderate stipend in one place might allow grad students to buy a house, while in another a higher stipend might still require multiple roommates in a small apartment. One useful website is https://livingwage.mit.edu, which calculates living wage in various places: you can multiply the hourly living wage by 2080 to get the annual living wage. For example, as of when our website was last updated, the living wage in Cambridge, MA, was $30.04 (so annual cost of $62,483) while the county containing Oxford, MS was $21.95 (annual cost of $45,656).\nHealthcare in the US is also a varied system. Eyes and dental care are treated separately from the rest of the body (and often are not covered by default), having a dependent spouse and/or children are additional costs, and there may be different deductibles and copays for treatment. You should be able to get details of what is included and costs when you get an offer of admission.\nNote that in most cases, the offer of admission and offer of support (as a TA and RA) come in together, but you could in most cases choose to separate them (though some programs do require teaching a semester or two). For example, if you happen to be wealthy, you could choose to pay your own tuition and not take a TA position. This is very rare.\n\n\n\nMost programs start in the Fall (which can be as early as August). The process to get into grad school starts nearly a full year before this:\n\nSeptember-October a year before the start: start contacting potential mentors. Also look to see if things like the GRE are required.\nBy October: consider applying for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP). A two page research proposal, three page personal statement, letters of rec and some similar materials, and you have a chance to get three years of funding for grad school. Check for the deadlines (they are very strict) and eligibility (you can only apply twice, and only if you are a US citizen or permanent resident).\nBy December (but check to make sure no earlier deadlines): Formally apply to programs. Make sure you have strong letters of rec lined up.\nJanuary-February: Interviews. Some programs will fly you out (they pay, usually) to visit the campus and meet with faculty and students, some will do this virtually, and some will not do this at all. These visits can be very informative; just remember that they are evaluating you while you are evaluating them. Are you curious? Will you work hard?\nJanuary-March: Offers of admission. You might get an unofficial offer, but check to see what your official offer letter includes (often details of funding).\nApril 15: Deadline to respond to offers of financial support, for all universities signed onto the April 15 Resolution. This keeps universities from using high pressure tactics to get you to commit before other offers come in. That said, if you get an offer before this you definitely will not accept (i.e., if you already have a better offer from another school, but are waiting to hear from more), it is kind to let the school know so they can offer the spot to someone else. If a university is giving you a deadline before April 15, that is a warning sign about that institution.\nApril-August: New offers might still go out as people decline offers, perhaps other students graduate earlier than expected, etc. So if you have not gotten an offer by mid-April, it still might be possible, though less likely.\n\nWatch for when your program expects you to start: they might have training before the semester starts. Note that in the US rentals typically require first and last month rent, plus a security deposit before you can move in; often universities will not start paying you until two or four weeks after you begin working (but fees, including for parking, might be due on the first day of the semester).\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of pressure to rank colleges for undergraduate programs: there are companies that make a lot of their money comparing different colleges, and there have even been allegations of cheating by colleges. It is a big deal if a college drops or rises multiple places on the US News ranking, for example. Going to a “top” college has a cachet that draws students and arguably has a major impact on future career options.\nSome groups do attempt to rank graduate programs in the same way, but they have much less impact. For one thing, it is hard to compare programs: how does a general biology program with faculty ranging from cell biology to pesticide development to fish anatomy compare to a specialized botany program? For another, the mentor matters a lot more to peers than the college. For undergrad, you might hear “I studied at”U. of Foo” but for grad school you are more likely to hear “My advisor was Dr. Smith.” Small sample size can also be a big issue: a set of three or four faculty in an area can make that school a “powerhouse” in that area – when two move away, the program changes a lot.\nSo the first question to ask is, “Who do I want as an advisor?” Then see if the program, location, and more can work for you.\nIn EEB it’s most common to first identify one or two mentors in a program and join their lab directly (while still being admitted to a program overall). Some programs, especially more general biology programs, have rotations where students work for a substantial period of time in different labs before an advisor is identified. In either case, it is still good to reach out to potential mentors early (and try them again if at first you do not get a reply: often they are in the field or otherwise inaccessible).\n\n\n\nSome things to consider:\n\nResearch interests: Are they doing the sort of work you want to do? Are they doing it recently? Some people shift research interests, go into administrative work, and similar so their current focus might not be what you need. https://openalex.org and https://scholar.google.com/ can be useful for finding interesting people.\nLab outcomes: Do their students get positions? Are they the sort of position you would want? Do their students graduate, drop out, or flee the lab? (https://web.archive.org can be good for looking at older versions of lab websites: who was on the “People” page but isn’t still there or on the “Alumni” page?). You should reach out to current and past students.\nLab size and career stage: Do you want to enter into a productive machine with a lot of postdocs and students who churn out papers but possibly less attention per student, or a small lab where there might be more attention but fewer projects to plug into? Is the professor going to be around for the duration of your degree or will they retire or move?\nAre they humane?: There is a lot of misconduct in academia. Power dynamics can be extreme, which can create an environment where this can happen and be underreported or be unaddressed when reported. You might find public information on misconduct (the https://academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org can be useful for this), but most is not public. Try to get a sense of this from your interactions with the potential mentors, their current and past lab personnel, other people in their department, and trusted people in the field. Not every whisper is true, but many are. Make sure not to endanger anyone who gives you information: “I heard from one of your students that…” puts that student at risk.\nMoney and other resources: Do they have funding? This will be on their CV; you can also get information from https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/ (just for NSF grants; they may have money from other sources). How do their students get funding for travel, for equipment, for fieldwork? Funding can be especially important in programs where a faculty member is expected to fund their students at least part of the time with research funds as RAs: is it a safe bet for you to assume they will bring in enough to cover you?\n\n\n\n\nStudies show grad school can be terrible for mental health. This does not mean people facing mental health challenges should avoid grad school, but it does mean that everyone should be aware of risks and consider strategies to mitigate them. Programs and mentors should be addressing these, as well – some are, others not so much. Does the program and mentor show awareness of this? Are there good resources? Do current students feel supported?\n\n\n\nGrad school is a place you will physically live in for multiple years. You, and any loved ones coming with you, have to be able to live there and be reasonably happy. Part of this is climate: if you hate cold, certain parts of the US might not be fun for you. Housing costs, availability of childcare, public transportation, access to your favorite activities, and more can all be important.\nOne thing that people might not expect is the heterogeneity of laws and customs in the US. Some laws are federal; some are state; some are local; and some policies are set by your institution. As a trivial example, there is no US federal law on whether someone can keep a ferret as a pet (but there might be a law about whether it can be brought onboard a commercial aircraft, or other limits). Some states have laws allowing them, some forbid them. In the states that do allow them, some cities could prohibit them. Even if the city allows them, your college might or might not allow pets in student offices. So if you really want to keep Mr. Fuzzysnake Magicpants on your desk, you have to look at all these different levels to decide if this is a place where you can. And note that any of these policies can change in the future.\nThere are many more serious issues that can vary dramatically by location in this way. There are heterogeneous policies on weapons, reproductive healthcare access, gender-affirming care, legality of certain drugs, rules on protests, and more. Some people don’t care about these issues; for others they might be critical (and in different directions depending on the individual). Consider what will be important to you and your loved ones when comparing locations. Remember the different levels of policy: an institution’s leadership might strongly favor one particular policy, but that might be moot if a law changes at a higher level. Even if your potential advisor is very aligned with your priorities, they may not be in control of the policies that affect you and cannot make any promises. Also note that institutional or higher level policies may also drive what is covered in the employee healthcare plan.\n\n\n\nThere are many levels of safety. ____________\n\n\n\nThe GRE is a standardized test that was once a common requirement for applicants to graduate school. It tests for high school level math and stats, including understanding of even and odd numbers, perimeter of shapes, reading bar charts, and more; verbal reasoning including reading comprehension and completing text; and analytical writing. It is over $200, but some student in the US can get a discount to $100 (I could not find out information on international fee reductions). There are also subject tests.\nMost programs have eliminated it in admissions: see Langin (2022). Its expense serves as a barrier to many students, and the information it purports to predict, grades in grad school, are not generally a major factor in research-based graduate programs. However, do check if the programs you are considering do still require it."
